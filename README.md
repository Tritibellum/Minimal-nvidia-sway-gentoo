# gentoo-configs

WARNING: DO NOT GIT CLONE THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!!!

this is my gentoo configuration files, meant to be kept minimal in disk, memory usage, and portage packages to compile.

with the configurations above (and additional steps to remove all bloat), will give you <300 MiBs in memory usage, aswell as ~300 packages in total (depending on what window manager you going to use).

please, do not copy my files and expect it to work, you're most likely going to have to change alot of things to fit your personal needs :3

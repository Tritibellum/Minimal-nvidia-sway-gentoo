# gentoo-configs

WARNING: DO NOT GIT CLONE THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!!!

this is my minimal nvidia gpu + amd cpu gentoo configuration files, meant to be kept minimal in disk, memory usage, and portage packages to compile.

with the configurations above (and additional steps to remove all bloat), will give you <300 MiBs in memory usage, aswell as ~300 packages in total (depending on what steps you want to take).

please, do not copy my files and expect it to work, you're most likely going to have to change alot of things to fit your personal needs :3

btw shoutout to RusselsTeap0t for making a guide for this already

you can follow his guide for more information (the guide is nvidia gpu + **intel cpu**)
